# Warwick R User Group

This group is for everybody interested in R, the programming language for statistical computing, data science, visualisation and reproducible reporting. Whether you are just learning R for the first time or are an expert R user, all are welcome. 😃

💻 Meetings are currently held online and are open to anyone, but we particularly welcome people from the West Midlands area.

📆 Join the Meetup group to get notified of upcoming events. You can also follow us on Twitter [@WarwickRUG](https://twitter.com/WarwickRUG).

The group was founded by organizers from the University of Warwick. Slides and resources from events in 2017-2019 are available on the [legacy web site](http://warwick.ac.uk/wrug).

Warwick R User Group follows the [R Consortium and R Community code of conduct](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct). ☑️
