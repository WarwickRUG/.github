# Warwick R User Group

This group is for everybody interested in R, the programming language for statistical computing, data science, visualisation and reproducible reporting. Whether you are just learning R for the first time or are an expert R user, all are welcome. 😃

💻 Meetings are currently held around once every two months, mostly online with occasional in person meetings at Warwick University. The meetings are open to anyone, but we particularly welcome people from the West Midlands area.

📆 Join the [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/WarwickRUG/) to get notified of upcoming events. You can also follow us on Mastodon [@WarwickRUG@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@WarwickRUG) or Twitter [@WarwickRUG](https://twitter.com/WarwickRUG).

🔗 Visit the [Warwick RUG website](https://warwickrug.github.io/) to find materials from recent events.

The group was founded by organizers from the University of Warwick. Slides and resources from events in 2017-2019 are available on the [legacy web site](http://warwick.ac.uk/wrug).

Warwick R User Group follows the [R Consortium and R Community code of conduct](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct). ☑️
